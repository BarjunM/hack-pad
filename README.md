# The DM’s Grimoire

The **DM’s Grimoire** is a D&D **macropad** built for Dungeon Masters to control their campaigns. With 9 mechanical keys, an OLED display, RGB lighting, and a custom spellbook‑style enclosure, this device becomes a physical “grimoire” of power for any tabletop roleplaying game.

## Why I Made This

As a long‑time Dungeon enjoyer and the permanent dungeon master (no thanks to my friends), I wanted something that was extremely functional — I wanted it to feel like an artifact from the game world itself. Instead of clicking around with a mouse, now I press a button and summon a thunderstorm… or a dragon roar.
